**About**

This is a web project I started some time ago and never finished. The inspiration behind this was to make a simple UI that let me see many stops around a "profile." Profiles are defined by things like "ISR" which would give all the busses coming around ISR.

**Todo**

Right now the API key is on the front end, users cannot define or save a profile, and the UI is not responsive. These are two immediate problems with the app. Feel free to take my code and do whatever you want (even commercialize), however please respect the following:

- Use a different API key for debugging. https://developer.cumtd.com
- The code is offered as is. I am not liable for it.

- (optional) Let me know the cool app you make!

**Further Ideas**

- When tapping / clicking on a tile, a window opens up with the GPS location of the bus along with the route of the bus painted on the map.
- Denote when a bus is a hopper/ltd (possibly adding a gradient https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/47mpjg/in_case_anyone_is_looking_for_a_project/d0ec2u3) .
